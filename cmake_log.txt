CMake Warning (dev) at /usr/share/cmake/pybind11/FindPythonLibsNew.cmake:101 (message):
  Policy CMP0148 is not set: The FindPythonInterp and FindPythonLibs modules
  are removed.  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0148" for policy details.  Use
  the cmake_policy command to set the policy and suppress this warning, or
  preferably upgrade to using FindPython, either by calling it explicitly
  before pybind11, or by setting PYBIND11_FINDPYTHON ON before pybind11.
